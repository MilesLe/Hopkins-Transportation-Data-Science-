THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS AND UPDATES WILL BE MADE BI-MONTHLY.

THIS PROJECT IS SO COOL!!!

Project Description:
Work with the Hopkins Transportation department with reducing the cost of their Blue Jay shuttler service and reducing the wait time and ride duration for students using the service. Hopkins Blue Jay Shuttle service is like Uber Pool but only for Hopkins students within 1 mile of Hopkins campuses. Students can request a shuttle to pick them and up to 4 other Hopkins students from a desired location and drop them off at another desired location, as long as the drop off and pick up locations are within 1 mile from the campus (with a few expections). Currently, the transportation department has faced an issue of meeting the high demand of the shuttle service used mostly by the undergraduate population. In order to continue to provide students with a convinient and safe method of travel, they have implemented the use of Lyft rides to remediate gaps in their service. However, these Lyft rides are expensive and the department wants to increase their productivity and efficiency to reduce and eventually eliminate the need for Lyft rides. Therefore, my goal is to use data provided by the department to deliver insights, tools, and ideas to reduce the cost of the shuttle service and improve the ridership for undergraduates. 

Data Descrption:
The data I have recieved is very similar to open source Uber or Lyft data found online. This data contains information related to the travel paths of students using the service.
Here are the features of the data: 'ride_id','service_name','origin_latitude', 'origin_longitude','destination_latitude', 'destination_longitude', 'rider_username','capacity', 'status', 'terminal_reason', 'created_at', 'duration', 'wait_time', 'completed_at', 'canceled_by', 'driver', 'vehicle'

Results:
Project still in progress...
